This is a simple console application that plays the children's game 'Guess the Animal'. 

There will be a list of animals available for guessing at the start. 
An option to add a new animal for guessing will be available after a guessing game has been completed. 
The new animal will be available next time the application runs.

The initial list of animals are stored in a text file in json format and any subsequent animal added to the list will be written to the same text file.
